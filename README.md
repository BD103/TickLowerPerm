# TickLowerPerm

[![Modrinth](https://img.shields.io/badge/Modrinth-gray?logo=modrinth) ![Mod Version](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/v/4ShukODo) ![Game Version](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/game-versions/4ShukODo)](https://modrinth.com/mod/ticklowerperm)

This is a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that lowers the permission of the `/tick` command in Minecraft from 3 to 2, allowing command blocks to run it. This mod specifically targets snapshots [23w43a](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_23w43a) through [23w44a](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_23w44a). This mod has no dependencies. It is required to run server side, but is optional client side. (Clients without this mod can connect to servers with this mod.) Additionally, it is required for single player worlds.
