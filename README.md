# TickLowerPerm

This is a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that lowers the permission of the `/tick` command in Minecraft from 3 to 2, allowing command blocks to 
run it. The mod specifically targets snapshot [23w43b](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_23w43b), but it may be updated to future snapshots when they are 
released. This mod has no dependencies.
